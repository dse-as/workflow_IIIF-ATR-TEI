               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_1_tl_2"/>Letter from Free French Africa 
               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_1_tl_3"/>Brazaville, June 1941 
               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_1_tl_4"/>Erika dearest,</p>
            <p> 
               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_1_tl_5"/>when I attempted to mail to you a letter and some manuscripts 
               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_1_tl_6"/>from San Thome, a couple of weeks ago, I was sure it would be the very last 
               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_1_tl_7"/>occasion to reach you for an unknown length of time, and I felt rather 
               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_1_tl_9"/>dramatic about it. In Lisbon <del rend="overstrike">you are</del> [add above: one is] told by exactly the people who should 
               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_1_tl_10"/>know better, that Free French territories and also [add abov: the] Belgian Congo are cut 
               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_1_tl_11"/>off from the rest of the world except for some cable and radio service. 
               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_1_tl_12"/>It seemed I was to be sent off into darkest Africa, in order to find even 
               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_1_tl_13" break="no"/>tually the disgave battlefield of vaguely known Free French legionnaries, 
               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_1_tl_16"/>of our civilisation.</p>
            <p> 
               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_1_tl_17"/>This sounded romantic, and not too bad, considering that in Europe our 
               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_1_tl_18"/>so-called normal life has gone, for good I suppose, – and to replace it, there 
               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_1_tl_19"/>is not even a battlefield left where one might fight. Except for the bea 
               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_1_tl_20" break="no"/>ting heart of London and [add above: still] some peaceful <del rend="overstrike">waiting</del> spots like Switzerland and 
               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_2_tl_3"/>Portugal, there is hardly anything to be found <del rend="overstrike">than</del> [add above: but] a sickening atmosphere 
               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_2_tl_4"/>of defeat and silent waiting.</p>

               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_2_tl_5"/>So, even if it should be a dangerous adventure and would mean a fairewell to 
               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_2_tl_6"/>what I had been in love with at home, I was determined to find my way into 
               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_2_tl_8"/>Africa, – which was, believe me, not an easy job.I got a visa for [add above: the] Belgian Congo,

               <lb xml:id="p001_tr_2_tl_11"/>I had ordered and payed for three months <del rend="overstrike">age</del> [add above: before]. On bord, nobody seemed to know

               <lb xml:id="p002_tr_1_tl_2"/>tutors, I might have followed the advice of a former French officer eager to 
               <lb xml:id="p002_tr_1_tl_3"/>join the De Gaule forces, and attempted to tramp my way through from Free

            <p> 
               <lb xml:id="p002_tr_1_tl_11"/>Since [add above: then], I found out that matters in this part of the world are less romantic 
               <lb xml:id="p002_tr_1_tl_13"/>than what I had thought, but also of far greater interest. [add above: As you know] I happened to be in

               <lb xml:id="p002_tr_3_tl_4"/>some ten months in the U.S., saw Europe again, – warstricken, increasingly hungry 
               <lb xml:id="p002_tr_3_tl_5"/>and impoverished. But never did I feel <del rend="overstrike">beeing</del> so close to events, so positive

               <lb xml:id="p002_tr_2_tl_1"/>Brazaville is the capital of Equitorial Africa, and the residence of the

               <lb xml:id="p002_tr_2_tl_14"/>its few little "cafe-restaurants" where you rarely see a civilian.</p>

               <lb xml:id="p003_tr_2_tl_3"/>places, you get a strong impression of how these French and Belgian

               <lb xml:id="p003_tr_2_tl_5"/>keeping up the fight for a common future. Nobody on either side even 
               <lb xml:id="p003_tr_2_tl_6"/>visualizes the possibility of a German victory, and the very idea of 
               <lb xml:id="p003_tr_2_tl_7"/>future is identified with the victory of the common cause. Both <del rend="overstrike">regio</del> 
               <lb xml:id="p003_tr_2_tl_8"/>colonies are gut off from their "motherland", but the Vichy government 
               <lb xml:id="p003_tr_2_tl_9"/>and the German occupation abroad are looked at as mere accidents of 
               <lb xml:id="p003_tr_2_tl_10"/>lost battles. Not yet touched by actual warfare, both Congos have a large 
               <lb xml:id="p003_tr_2_tl_11"/>number of their men on the African battlefield, the French with the 
               <lb xml:id="p003_tr_2_tl_12"/>De Gaulle forces, the Belgians mainly in Abessynia. While the mother 
               <lb xml:id="p003_tr_2_tl_13"/>countries go through the agony of defeat, the colonies are developping 
               <lb xml:id="p003_tr_1_tl_1"/>into greater economical strength, independance, and self confidence. I 
               <lb xml:id="p003_tr_1_tl_2"/>would not be surprised if the war would help here to prepare the United
