<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_6"/>– and the very prospect to be able to mail a letter to you, which
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_7"/>eventually should arrive in the U.S., is a relief. It means, one is
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_8"/>still in contact with another life than the slow, heavy breath of
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_9"/>the jungle, and makes the pulse go a little faster.</CONV><CONV tag="p">
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_10"/>Besides of myself, the shopkeepers among the fourty white of this
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_11"/>post are busy, too, to get some mail ready, – the others dont care
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_12"/>anymore. <PAGE tag="strikethrough">It seems</PAGE> The main event in the "brousse" – (which means
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_13"/>'jungle', and a lot more) is obviously the arrival of the riverboats
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_14"/>carrying fresh food, such as butter, meat, fruit, and vegetables,
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_15"/>mostly from the Cape. Since the stocks of French wine and Scotch
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_16"/>whisky are emptied, Colonial might even get used to drink
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_17"/>South African liquor. But they are conservative people, and at
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_18"/>present, nothing is left than some Congo beer. A few nights ago, I
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_19"/>have sorrowly finished with some friends from Luxembourg a last
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_20"/>bottle<PAGE tag="strikethrough">r</PAGE> of Alsacian "Framboise", the combination with a dinner of

<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_27"/>It is normally important, first, to proove, that a European country
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_28"/>invaded and occupied by the Germans, is not in fact defeated.
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_29"/>Antwerp used to be the port for the Congo. Belgian industrial and
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_30"/>commercial companies in the Congo did all their business
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_31"/>through their main offices in the motherland.</CONV><CONV tag="p">

<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_33"/>one grain of Congo coffee, not one once of gold, no copper, no tin,
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_34"/>no palm oil, no arachide, no copal,no cotton, tobacco or rice out
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_35"/>of this trimendously rich colony, – which is eighty times the size

<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_37"/>Yet, business in the Congo has not suffered. The output of copper,
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_38"/>tin and gold is even increaseing. Under the new trade agreement
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_39"/>with Great Britain, England buys almost the entire output of <PAGE tag="strikethrough">the</PAGE>
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_40"/>copper from the Katanga, of palme oil, and diamonds. The 500 000
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_41"/>onces of Congo fine gold a year is added to Britain's reserve.
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_42"/>The timber is sold to the South African Union. A good deal of
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_43"/>ores from the Congo are shipped to the U.S. for refining. The <PAGE tag="strikethrough">rest</PAGE>
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_001_tr_1_tl_44"/>remaining of the 1940 coffee crop is also sold on the New York

<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_2"/>As to the imports, there was of course a shortage right after the
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_3"/>invasion of Belgium. All European sources were suddenly closed, and
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_4"/>stocks in the country got exhausted. But the orientation towards
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_5"/>the South African Union, England, the U.S. and Canada began at once,
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_6"/>shipping from the Cape to the Congo port of Matadi is steadily
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_7"/>intreased, and the arrival of goods is by now fairly regular.</CONV><CONV tag="p">
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_8"/>At the same time, agericultural production and local industries are
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_9"/>developping rapidly. In the Katanga, farmers now produce milk, butter
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_10"/>eggs, fruit, and vegetables, in the Kivu mountain regions they plant
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_11"/>tobacco and even tea, – indead, this country should be rich enough
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_12"/>to make its 30 000 White live on its own ressources [Kommentar zur kolonialen Logik dieses Satzes, da der großteil der eigentlichen Arbeit/Produktion durch die indigene Bevölkerung geschieht].</CONV><CONV tag="p">
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_13"/>But there should be more roads, railroads, and airlines. While I was
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_14"/>in Leopoldville, I naturally could'nt realize that enormous parts of
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_15"/>the Congo are still untouched wilderness [damit meint AS: von Weissen nicht 'kultivierter' Regenwald, der jedoch Lebensgrundlage für die indigene Bevölkerung ist]. In order to reach Lisala,
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_16"/>some 800 miles up the river from Leo, I had to travel 7 days on a
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_17"/>riverboat, – and you saw day and night nothing than the trimendous
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_18"/>green walls of the jungle,  – native villages beeing just tiny cleared
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_19"/>spots with dozen primitive huts and some wood biled up on the bank.
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_20"/>At night, we used to stop a few hours in order to load wood for our
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_21"/>engines, than we would carry on in the dim moonlight, winding through
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_22"/>thousands of islands covered with thick green.</CONV><CONV tag="p">
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_23"/>From Leopoldville to Lisala, there is no road, only the river. And if
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_24"/>you look at the “brousse”, which is just like an ocean extending to
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_25"/>all sides and closing the horizon, you come to believe that you will
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_26"/>never find your way into an open space again. It is rather frightening.
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_27"/>Now, I am in this spot at the river since ten days, waiting for some
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_28"/>means of transportation to reach a plantation, some 200 miles inland.
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_29"/>If I am lucky, a lorry is going into that direction, some day. Mean¬

<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_31"/>Among the fourty white, there are some shopkeepers and agents,
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_32"/>selling goods to the black, and buying their product, mainly palm fruit
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_33"/>for their companies. They get percentages from what they sell, and if
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_34"/>they work hard, they can make some money. But in this climate – we are
<lb xml:id="letter_0174_002_tr_1_tl_35"/>in the Equator region – it takes a lot of energy to work.</CONV><CONV tag="p">
